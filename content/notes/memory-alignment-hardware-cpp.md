## Overview

This note presents a structured view of how memory alignment and hardware-level constraints interact with the C++ object model and compiler guarantees. It connects the requirements of modern hardware architectures with language-level semantics.

---

## Memory Model

C++ programs operate in a virtual memory space divided into regions for **code**, **static data**, **stack**, and **heap**. Dynamic allocation (`new`, `malloc`) reserves space on the heap, returning a pointer satisfying platform alignment guarantees.

Each allocation unit is defined in **bytes**. For example:

```cpp
unsigned char* buffer = new unsigned char[1024];
```

The returned address obeys `alignof(std::max_align_t)`, typically 8 or 16 bytes on 64-bit systems.

---

## Alignment Definition

Let an address $ A $ and alignment $ k \in \mathbb{N} $.  
$ A $ is *k-aligned* if and only if

$$
A \bmod k = 0.
$$

Alignment ensures that the address of an object satisfies the boundary constraints required by the underlying hardware.

---

## Hardware Considerations

Processors read and write memory through buses that operate on fixed-size chunks. These transfer units determine the natural alignment requirements.

| Level | Typical Width | Function |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Register | 8–64 B | Data path width for arithmetic units |
| Bus Transaction | 8–16 B | Transfer width between cache and memory |
| Cache Line | 64 B | Unit of cache coherence |
| Page | 4 KiB | Virtual memory mapping granularity |

If an object crosses one of these boundaries, multiple transfers or traps may occur.

---

## Misalignment

A misaligned access occurs when the address of a load or store does not satisfy its alignment. Its effect is architecture-dependent.

| Architecture | Behavior |
|---------------|-----------|
| x86-64 | Permitted, slower due to split transactions |
| ARM64 | Traps (`SIGBUS`) |
| RISC-V | Optional trap or emulation |

Aligned access guarantees that a load/store fits entirely within one bus transaction.

---

## C++ Language Rules

C++ enforces that every object’s address satisfies its alignment requirement:

$$
\text{address} \bmod \text{alignof}(T) = 0.
$$

The alignment requirement \( \text{alignof}(T) \) is a compile-time constant depending on the target ABI (Application Binary Interface).

| Type | `sizeof(T)` | `alignof(T)` | Notes |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| `char` | 1 | 1 | Always aligned |
| `int` | 4 | 4 | Matches word size |
| `double` | 8 | 8 | Matches bus width |
| `struct { char c; double d; }` | 16 | 8 | Padding inserted |
| `alignas(64) float v[8];` | 32 | 64 | Manual over-alignment |

---

## Over-Alignment

Manual over-alignment is declared using `alignas(N)`. It enforces that the object’s address is a multiple of \( N \). Example:

```cpp
struct alignas(64) Vec4 {
    float data[4];
};
```

### Motivation

- SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) operations (AVX/AVX-512)
- Cache-line isolation in concurrent programs
- DMA and accelerator interfaces requiring aligned buffers

If the requested alignment exceeds hardware capability, the compiler inserts sufficient padding to maintain correctness. This is a compile-time guarantee; performance behavior depends on the target architecture.

---

## Relationship Between Size and Alignment

$$
\text{alignof}(T) \leq \text{sizeof}(T).
$$

Equality is common for primitive types. Structs and arrays may have $ \text{alignof}(T) < \text{sizeof}(T) $ due to internal padding. The C++ standard only enforces address correctness, not divisibility between size and alignment.

---

## Misalignment Visualization

### Proper Alignment (8-byte `double`)

```
Bus boundary: ─────────┬────────┬────────
                       0x1000   0x1008   0x1010
Aligned: [0x1008–0x100F] → one 8B transaction
```

### Misalignment (starts at 0x100A)

```
Bus boundary: ─────────┬────────┬────────
                       0x1000   0x1008   0x1010
Misaligned: [0x100A–0x1011] → spans two transactions
```

### Byte-Aligned (`char`)

```
No restriction: alignment = 1
```

---

## Key Properties

| Concept | Definition |
|----------|-------------|
| **Alignment** | Boundary constraint on object address. |
| **Size** | Number of bytes occupied by the object. |
| **Natural alignment** | Alignment chosen automatically by the compiler. |
| **Over-alignment** | User-specified stronger boundary constraint. |
| **Misalignment** | Address violating required boundary; undefined behavior. |
| **Hardware constraint** | The compiler never enforces alignment stricter than hardware support. |

---

## Summary

1. Alignment guarantees that memory accesses conform to hardware transfer boundaries.  
2. Misaligned loads or stores can incur penalties or hardware traps.  
3. $ \text{alignof}(T) $ defines the minimum alignment for a type.  
4. `alignas(N)` allows manual over-alignment beyond natural alignment.  
5. The compiler ensures $ \text{alignof}(T) \leq \text{hardware\_max\_alignment} $.
