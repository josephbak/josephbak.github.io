# Evolution of Branch Prediction and Its Parallels with SSA → SSI

## 1. Branch Prediction Evolution

Branch prediction has been one of the most important microarchitectural
techniques for exploiting instruction-level parallelism in CPUs.

-   **Static Prediction (pre-1980s):**
    -   Early CPUs simply recorded which way the branch went last time
        and predicted the same outcome.
    -   Accuracy: \~85%.
    -   Hardware cost: \~1K bits.
-   **Two-bit and Multi-bit Counters (1980s--1990s):**
    -   Added history with saturating counters (2-bit, 3-bit, etc.).
    -   Improved accuracy to \~90--92%.
    -   Example: "predict taken if counter ≥ threshold."
    -   Hardware: a few kilobits.
-   **Global + Local History (1990s--2000s):**
    -   Recognized that outcome may depend on *how you got there* (path
        history).
    -   E.g., "Bob likes Jane" vs "Bob likes Jill" example → different
        outcomes.
    -   Combined global history with counters.
-   **Neural / Perceptron Predictors (2000s--today):**
    -   Use perceptron-like learning: weight vectors times history bits.
    -   Essentially a small neural net in silicon.
    -   Accuracy \>95--99%.
    -   Hardware cost: tens of megabits.
    -   Modern branch predictors are like "tiny supercomputers" inside
        CPUs.
-   **Speculative Execution with Invariance Tracking (modern
    research):**
    -   Even if mispredicted, CPU can sometimes reuse invariant
        computations.
    -   Analogy: misunderstanding a paragraph but still being able to
        use facts in the next one.

## 2. SSA → SSI Evolution

In compiler theory, Static Single Assignment (SSA) form also evolved to
handle path-sensitive information, which parallels branch prediction
evolution.

-   **SSA (1980s):**
    -   Each variable is assigned exactly once.
    -   φ-nodes merge values from different control-flow paths.
    -   Enables easier dataflow analysis.
-   **SSI (Static Single Information, 1990s):**
    -   Extends SSA with σ-nodes (propagation of *predicates* along
        branches).
    -   Adds history/context: the value of a variable may depend on the
        *branch condition* taken.
    -   This is similar to branch predictors adding *path history* for
        accuracy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Parallels Between Branch Prediction and SSA → SSI

-   **Base Case (Last Outcome vs SSA):**
    -   Last-outcome prediction is like plain SSA: keeps track of values
        (or outcomes) but without context.
-   **Adding History (Counters vs σ-nodes):**
    -   Multi-bit counters and global history parallel the move from SSA
        to SSI, where additional information (context) is preserved.
-   **Learning-based (Neural Predictors vs Path-sensitive IR):**
    -   Just as neural predictors recognize deeper patterns, SSI and
        advanced compiler IRs capture richer flow-sensitive invariants.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Timeline Summary

-   **1980s:** Last-outcome prediction, SSA formalization.
-   **1990s:** Two-bit counters, global history predictors, SSI
    introduction.
-   **2000s--2020s:** Perceptron predictors, neural nets; research into
    predicate-sensitive IR and advanced SSA variants.
